## Overview
We are exploring the viability of duplicating the citi bikes model that is used in New York City for Des Moines, IA. Using publicly available data and tableau, we have created a series of visualizations to make a compelling case for investment.
## Results
After analyzing the data and creating visualizations, we found that males use the bikes more than females and that they are used mostly by subscribers as opposed to one time users. The majority of bike rides start in the Manhattan borough of New York City and end there as well. When looking at the times they are used, people ride the bikes frequently on the way to and from work on the weekdays and then throughout the day on the weekends.
## Summary
Some other visualizations that could be investigated would be to look at common starting points and seeing the frequencies there. I'd also be interested in seeing if there is any commonality between the common starting locations and the differences between gender and user type. Lastly, if this model were to be implemented in Des Moines, we would want to understand these starting and ending locations so that bikes can be placed in similar places in Des Moines.
